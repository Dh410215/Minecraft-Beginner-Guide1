## 1. "Create New World" Screen (Game Mode & Difficulty)
In this menu you create your new Minecraft world. Here you pick the game mode you want, insert a seed (optional), and select the difficulty. You can choose Survival or Creative mode (Hardcore is also available in Java Edition) and set the difficulty (Peaceful, Easy, Normal, or Hard) for your new world. The screen also has options like Allow Cheats and experimental toggles. Once you’re happy with the settings, click Create New World to generate the world.

## 2. Punching a Tree for Wood
Punching Minecraft trees is essential to getting wood which is the building block and essential
to starting the game and building your bed and house with wood. And most importantly making
a crafting table. Wood is also the basic block to creating sticks which helps you make tools for
your swords and utility. Wood from logs is the first resource; collect a few logs by holding down
the attack button on a tree. This yields wooden logs, which can then be crafted into planks and
used to make your first tools and crafting table.

## 3. Crafting Table & Basic Tool Crafting
The 3×3 crafting grid interface, accessed by using a Crafting Table
After gathering wood, craft wooden planks and then a Crafting Table (4 planks in a 2×2 grid).
Using the crafting table opens a 3×3 crafting menu
Here you can create basic wooden tools. For example, to make a wooden pickaxe, arrange 3
wood planks across the top row and 2 sticks in the middle of the next two rows – three wood
planks plus two sticks in the pattern yields a wooden pickaxe
With these first tools, you can harvest stone and coal, paving the way for better tools

## 4. First-Night Shelters (Dirt Hut and Cave)
For your first night, quickly build a small shelter before darkness. Many players craft a 4×4 (or
similar) dirt hut as a quick safehouse – even a basic dirt box can keep monsters out. Place a
door for convenience and a torch for light. Alternatively, you can dig into a hillside:

In fact, you can create a base on a hillside where you're protected by the walls around you so no mobs can spawn there.
By hollowing out a little cave and blocking the entrance, you get a safe “hobbit hole.” Whichever style you choose, ensure you have light (torches) and a 1-block opening (with door or blocks) that monsters cannot get through overnight.
