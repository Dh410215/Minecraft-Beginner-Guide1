## 1. "Create New World" Screen (Game Mode & Difficulty)
In this menu you create your new Minecraft world. Here you pick the game mode you want, insert a seed (optional), and select the difficulty. You can choose Survival or Creative mode (Hardcore is also available in Java Edition) and set the difficulty (Peaceful, Easy, Normal, or Hard) for your new world. The screen also has options like Allow Cheats and experimental toggles. Once you’re happy with the settings, click Create New World to generate the world.

## 2. Punching a Tree for Wood
Punching Minecraft trees is essential to getting wood which is the building block and essential
to starting the game and building your bed and house with wood. And most importantly making
a crafting table. Wood is also the basic block to creating sticks which helps you make tools for
your swords and utility. Wood from logs is the first resource; collect a few logs by holding down
the attack button on a tree. This yields wooden logs, which can then be crafted into planks and
used to make your first tools and crafting table.
